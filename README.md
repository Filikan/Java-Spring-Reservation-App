# lab-reservation-app

This project is created why we're going to develop a lab reservation app to provide host details and book. Our expectation is that this project eventually will enable a PoC. 

Tech stack is following:
Back-end: Java (Spring)
Front-end: React
Database: PostgreSQL
Containerization: Docker

Details of implementation are below:
Roles: User, super user (admin)

Use cases:
1. User is able to log in.
2. User is able to display all server information.
3. User is able to book (due date and description are required).
4. User is able to extend reservation.
5. Super user is able to perform all CRUD operations.

@Ege, could you complete use cases?
