# Lab Reservation Tool

This project is created why we're going to develop a lab reservation app to provide host details and book. Our expectation is that this project eventually will enable a PoC. 

## Tech stack is following
1. Back-end: Java (Spring)
2. Front-end: React
3. Database: PostgreSQL
4. Containerization: Docker

## Details of implementation are below
- Roles: User, super user (admin)

To Do:
* User is able to log in.
* User is able to extend reservation.
* Inform the user one week left to deadline

In Progress:
* User is able to book (due date and description are required)
  * User can make reservation but **Check Dates** button is not working yet.

Done:
* User is able to display all server information.
* User can add server.
* There is also uml diagram named uml.drawio in project directory.

### How To Open Project At First:
1. Install PostgreSQL and install pgAdmin4 
2. Confugre Database following informations from ***BBConstants.java*** 
    ```java
    private static final String DB_CONN_URL = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/deneme";
    private static final String DB_CONN_USERNAME = "postgres";
    private static final String DB_CONN_PASSWORD = "admin";
    ```
  3. Create tables manually in Database regarding to ***BBConstants.java***
```java
     private static final String CREATE_USER_TABLE = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users " +
            "(ID INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY," +
            " USER_NAME TEXT, " +
            " FIRST_NAME TEXT, " +
            " LAST_NAME TEXT, " +
            " EMAIL VARCHAR(50), " +
            " DEPARTMENT TEXT, " +
            " PASSWORD VARCHAR(50))";

    private static final String CREATE_SERVER_TABLE = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS servers " +
            "(ID SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY ," +
            " SERVER_NAME TEXT, " +
            "SERVER_LOCATION TEXT," +
            " SERVER_IP TEXT," +
            "SERIAL_NUMBER TEXT, " +
            "SERVER_TYPE TEXT," +
            "IS_HOST BOOLEAN)";


    private static final String CREATE_RESERVATÄ°ON_TABLE = " CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reservation" +
            "(ID SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY," +
            "USER_ID INT ," +
            "SERVER_ID INT REFERENCES servers (ID) ," +
            "START_DATE DATE, " +
            "END_DATE DATE, " +
            "STATUS BOOLEAN," +
            "REASON TEXT)";

    private static final String CREATE_GROUP_TABLE = " CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS groups" +
            "(ID INT PRIMARY KEY  NOT NULL," +
            "GROUP_NAME TEXT)";
   ```
   4. Import **data.csv** to your database while using pgAdmin4 
   5. After making that preparations, It should work fine. Open project with any code editor like **Visual Studio Code**.
   6. Install java extensions and Run project.
   7. After running. Paste that link to your browser to go project result: http://localhost:8080/
